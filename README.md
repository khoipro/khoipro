## What Excites Me in 2021

- ðŸ“ˆ Release our framework, including a parent WordPress theme [ct-bones](https://github.com/codetot-web/ct-bones) and a WordPress plugin to build blocks [ct-blocks](https://github.com/codetot-web/ct-blocks). With those tools in our hands, we crafted many **HIGH-PERFORMANCE** websites from e-commerce websites to corporation pages. Also, it helps our developers improve the build process of a new project from 30 days to around 2 weeks.
- ðŸ§¯ Release the Optimization services for WordPress websites. We got some clients, most are using old page builder plugins. The final score is greater (from 70+) and their websites are now fast loading even with video embed or multiple products shown.

> You know, fast websites got more conversation, right?

## What's my challenges?

**Gutenberg Block Editor Develompent Flow**

Currently, we already release a few first custom blocks, including:

- Accordions
- Image Slider
- Post Grid

We aim to release 20 blocks, including most of user interactive blocks, from Tabs, Popup to Form section.

**New WordPress Plugins**

We hear customer's voice and do a custom plugin follow their wishes.
